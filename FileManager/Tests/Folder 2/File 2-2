As the fastest aircraft ever built, the North American x-15 is classified as hypersonic rather than supersonic since it can travel faster than five times the speed of sound. It still holds the record for the fastest manned aircraft, with the majority of later aircraft not even coming close. Its peak speed is 4520 mph (6.7 Mach).
The plane had to be dropped from another aircraft because its tail fin prevented it from taking off at slow speeds. Prior to being retired, the aircraft was primarily utilized for research flights, but it nevertheless achieved a record for speed that hasnâ€™t been surpassed in any way.
